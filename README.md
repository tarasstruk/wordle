# wordle

A simplified Wordle game written in Rust language.

### To start the game:

* [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* in your terminal:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:tarasstruk/wordle.git
cd wordle
cargo run
# or
cargo run sample.txt
```

Instead of `sample.txt` you can provide your own dictionary file as a text-file 
containing 4 ASCII-characters words separated by newlines.

### To run tests:
```sh
cargo test
```
